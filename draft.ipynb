      "Final Response: Kings are typically male monarchs who rule over a kingdom or territory. Historically, they have wielded significant power and influence, often governing with the support of nobility and military might. Notable kings include figures like Alexander the Great, King Solomon, and King Louis XIV, each renowned for their contributions to history, culture, or governance. The role of kingship has evolved over time, with many modern monarchs serving as ceremonial figures rather than absolute rulers, reflecting changes in political systems and societal values."
